 * @brief Sends a request to activate/deactivate call barring.
 *
 * @details This service allows a mobile subscriber to activate barring of certain categories
 *          of outgoing or incoming calls according to a barring program which is selected from a set
 *          of one or more barring programs chosen at provision time and is valid for all outgoing or incoming calls, or just those associated
 *          with a specific basic service group. Also this API allows deactivating call barring based on categories set.
 *          If the user calls this function with a wrong password 3 times subsequently, the barring service can be blocked.
 *          If this function is called normally, the asynchronous response comes in a few seconds from the network. The response indicates
 *          whether the service request has been granted or not.
 *
 *          This API makes a Dbus method call to the Telephony Server and gets an immediate feedback.
 *          However it just means that the API request has been transfered to the CP successfully.
 *          The actual operation result is delivered with the async response as below.
